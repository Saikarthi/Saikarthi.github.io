              Two player puzzle game developed for Barckeys Game Jam in 7 DAYS.
              Do you like to play puzzle games? Especially a multiplayer, but
              technically a single player. Confusing right? Well, THE DARK is a
              single/multiplayer player game which has two avatars, but both can
              be controlled by a single/multiple person(s). This game has four
              levels, in which the player has to find and solve the puzzles to
              get out of that room. Clues are present in both avatar’s play
              space. Unless the clues from both the sides are found, the player
              can’t get out of that room. Be aware that the player has to form a
              word/number from the clues he/she found to crack the puzzle. Ready
              to experience the brain crushing puzzle? Try it out and get
              astonished!
