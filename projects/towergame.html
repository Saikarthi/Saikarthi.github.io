            <h2>Tower Game </h2>
            <p>
            Build the highest tower of blocks in this funny stack game.
            Building your construction seems easy, but it takes some skills,
            balance games and best timing for build the highest skyscraper from stacking blocks.
            It's okay if the tower falls, you can enjoy the view of the falling tower blocks.
            <br />
            How to Play <br />
            ● Tap to drop a block. <br />
            ● Stack blocks up and construct a tower. <br />
            ● Monitor the balance and the declination of the tower. <br />
            ● Undo the mistake if you do it. <br />
            ● Stacking blocks <br />

            It has some bug.
