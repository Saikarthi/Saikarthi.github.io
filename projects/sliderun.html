            <h2>Slide Run</h2>
            <p>
              Slide Run is a Endless game developed for learning purpose. Then I came up with a thought that why can't I develope further.

              So I add some feautures. As like other Endless games, this game also have the same rules like miss track.
              
              The unique thing I implemented is this game supports both FPP and TPP. The Obstacles are created according to the player's position, so that it will be challenging to play.
              
              At my first release to my friends for testing they came up with a bug that the obstacles are falling on our head. And then I fixed that bug and make the game clear.
