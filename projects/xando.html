              Tik Tok Toe is a puzzle game which we played in our childhood during our class hours. Golden memories, isn't?

              That's why I have developed this game in the way we played! This game is under development. I'm about to add some other features like Scoreboard, Timelimit, Multiplayer over multi-devices, etc.
              
              Unlike other game I developed, this game was developed from scratch with my code. The Fun fact is that this game is completely made of if/else statements...!
              
              I have also planned to make the player to play against the AI with different AI levels (Beginner AI, Semi-Pro AI, Professional AI, Ameture AI, World-Class AI, Lengendary AI).
              
              The players can choose their oponents themselves.
