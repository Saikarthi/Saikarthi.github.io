            <h2>Legzoid</h2>
            <p>
              Legzoid is a game inspired from games like Call of Duty, PUBG. As
              a gamer I have a wish that these games are not Logically perfect.
              The game will be perfect if equal power is given to player. So
              that the skilled player among them will win the title. Thus I
              developed this game with same pistol for all the players with
              limited bullets. The players have to use the shots clearly or else
              they miss the chance of winning the title. They can re-spawn if
              they want. The bullet count won't be change after the re-spawn.
              This makes us to choose the best skilled player opt for the tile.
              This game is a multi-device multiplayer game. Players who are in
              same network can play this game in offline too.
